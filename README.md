<h2>Description <sup><em>(What is this?)</em></sup></h2>
This addon provides the Unity Editor with an alternative inspector/editor for .guiskin files.

<h2>Reason <sup><em>(Why was it made?)</em></sup></h2>
The editor was created to provide an alternative to the default guiskin editor that focused on performance when editing large numbers of guistyles and allowed other extended features for easier/faster maintenence.

<h2>Features <sup><em>(What can it do?)</em></sup></h2>
<ul>
<li>Supports 3 display modes (Default, Replica, and Compact).</li>
<li>Supports searching of styles by name or attributes. Searches can be explicit or use wildcards.</li>
<li>Supports visual forms for constructing advanced search queries.</li>
<li>Supports copy/paste of GUIStyles.</li>
<li>Supports searching/grouping separated fragment guiskin files from parent (i.e : MySkin#Buttons.guiskin belongs to MySkin.guiskin set)</li>
<li>Supports off-screen padding/clipping of non-visible elements for smooth framerate even when hundreds of styles present.</li>
<li>Default mode uses Unity's built-in editor.</li>
<li>Replica mode visually mimic's Unity's built-in editor with extra performance/features.</li>
<li>Compact mode focuses on more direct access to style options.</li>
</ul>
