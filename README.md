<h2>Description <sup><em>(What is this?)</em></sup></h2>
This addon provides the Unity Editor with an alternative inspector/editor for .guiskin files.

<h2>Reason <sup><em>(Why was it made?)</em></sup></h2>
The editor was created to provide an alternative to the default guiskin editor that focused on performance when editing large numbers of guistyles and allowed other extended features for easier/faster maintenence.

<h2>Features <sup><em>(What can it do?)</em></sup></h2>
* Supports 3 display modes (Default, Replica, and Compact).
* Supports searching of styles by name or attributes. Searches can be explicit or use wildcards.
* Supports visual forms for constructing advanced search queries.
* Supports copy/paste of GUIStyles.
* Supports searching/grouping separated fragment guiskin files from parent (i.e : MySkin#Buttons.guiskin belongs to MySkin.guiskin set)
* Supports off-screen padding/clipping of non-visible elements for smooth framerate even when hundreds of styles present.
* Default mode uses Unity's built-in editor.
* Replica mode visually mimic's Unity's built-in editor with extra performance/features.
* Compact mode focuses on more direct access to style options.
